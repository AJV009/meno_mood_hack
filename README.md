# Meno Mood Hack App (Prototype Stage!)
Control **Menopause mood swings**. Based on meditation and music techniques.
This app and repo was created for the [Hacking Menopause by Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/contests/aarpmenopause) competition.

Am a Indian kid just started to learn develop mobile applications. So am more like a software guy than hardware. Even though Menopause is a new thing to me and only for girls or women I have a little sister and mother to take care of! So it makes sense for me to contribute with the knowledge I have about App Development and little bit of Machine Learning (ML). Being a Software kid I couldnt think of any Hardware solutions and I guess there are many Hardware developers out there making some amazing solution for Menopause.

After watching the "AARP Hacking Menopause Webinar" I felt that that I could solve some Menopause symptoms like anxiety and stress using mobile applications. This is my first ever mobile application so suggestions are welcomed.
This project guide will take you through the whole app structure and Menopause symptoms.

## Menopause
- Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after you've gone 12 months without a menstrual period.
- Menopause can happen in your 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States.
- Menopause is a natural biological process. Menopause is a stage of life that nearly every woman will experience. Yet, this very natural phase in a womanâ€™s life is often not discussed nor well understood.
- One in three American women are currently in a phase of menopause 20% of the American workforce is currently experiencing menopause.
- Very few women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
- Perimenopause is the 4-10 years leading up to that point can bring a variety of disruptive symptoms to a woman. In the postmenopausal period, some symptoms can diminish, while new ones appear.
- Hot flashes are the most known symptom of menopause. Did you know there are over 35 other symptoms that women might experience during the three phases of menopause.
- **Hot Flashes** - A sudden wave of mild or intense body heat caused by rushes of hormonal changes resulting from decreased levels of estrogen. Hot flashes can occur at any time and may last from a few seconds to a half-hour. They are due to blood vessel opening and constricting and a symptom of menopause.

## How can apps help
Some points to note for a person not in good health - Music, Meditation, control over sleep and fluid intake.
- Music can help a lot in concentration and help in distracting you from thinking more and more about your menopause issues. So during the project we will be including a YouTube plugin to randomly play some concentration music by Brain.fm.
- Reminders can help in reminding of fluid intake which is one of keeping menopause in control. Lack of body fluids can cause dizziness which could case harm to your productivity or work assigned.
- Activity recorder can record activities such as Hot flashes, Meal intake, sleep, exercise, moods, symptoms, periods, dizziness. These data collected can be submitted to a doctor for further diagnoses.
- Machine Learning can help in predicting hot flash and periods* based on the data collected everyday. We can run basic ML algorithms such as RandomForest and LinearRegression to get good results. We don't need any complex custom algorithms as far as the data is concerned. (Data on menopause which we collect during app usage seems to be relatable in some way or the other)
- Meditation can come really handy to control constant mood swings. The most simple breath in breath out meditation is a very effective method for stressed out people while it does take some time to get used to even such simple meditation techniques.
- Voice assistant can help you get your work done without touching your phone. Using STT (speech to text) and TTS(text to speech) modules for reminding you of task, reading you out good blogs on menopause to make you feel good. As of now google keyboards comes with voice features so you fill any input text area with your voice.
- Quickly connect with nearby doctors in case of emergencies and any problems.
- Meet and reach out to people for more personal care.

## Why Flutter over other Android Frameworks?
- Same UI and business logic in all platforms. Single code base works for iOS, Android, Web and Desktop.
- Hot Reload, Hot Restart saves a ton of time compared to other Android frameworks. Using this feature Flutter actually changes that specific line of code in the deployment instead of rebuilding the whole thing again.
- Almost Native App performance because its build using Dart so nothing to do with JavaScript and much faster than React Native.
- Custom, polished, flexible and smooth UI
- As you can see I developed this app from scratch in just 4-5 days. This is perfect for MVP (Minimal Viable Product). Develop quickly and lauch quickly to both iOS and Android in the same time.

## Features and what my App does?
**(I have also menstioned the features which I have have partially coded)**
- Record **activities** like Periods, Water intake and Sleep comfortability. (menopause tracker)
- Fetching some of the best **blogs** to guide women with menopause.
- Create **Insights** (graphs and prediction) using the previous collected data.
- Play **music** for optimum concentration while work.
- Connect with **doctors** nearby in case of emergency.
- An about page to start collaborating for development of this app.

- **Please give kudos to the above package publishers, its because of their packages today we can quicly create a flutter app from scratch.**
- [main.dart](/lib/main.dart)
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_navigation_bar/curved_navigation_bar.dart';
import 'content.dart';
Content cont = new Content();
void main() => runApp(MaterialApp( home: MenoMood(),  title: 'MenoHack', ), );
class MenoMood extends StatefulWidget { @override _MenoMoodState createState() { cont.makeList(); return _MenoMoodState(); } }
class _MenoMoodState extends State<MenoMood> {
  int _page = 0; 
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Menopause Mood Hack!',
          style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Lobster', fontSize: 30),),
          backgroundColor: Colors.pink,),
        bottomNavigationBar: CurvedNavigationBar( index: 0, height: 50.0, items: cont.menuIcons,
          color: Colors.yellow.shade200, buttonBackgroundColor: Colors.white, backgroundColor: Colors.teal.shade700,
          animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut, animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          onTap: (index) { setState(() { _page = index; }); },
        ),
        body: Container(
          decoration: BoxDecoration(image: DecorationImage(image: AssetImage('asset/images/splash.png'), fit: BoxFit.cover)),
          child: Center( child: ListView(children: cont.changePage(_page) ), ),
        ),
    );
  }
}
```
The main file is like a skelaton as the actual code resides in the content file. We have used some custom fonts downloaded externally in this app.

- [content.dart](/lib/content.dart) (just some important snips of the full code)
```dart
  static openBrowserTab(String url) async { await FlutterWebBrowser.openWebPage(url: url, androidToolbarColor: Colors.pink.shade100); }
```
openBrowserTab is snip for in-app browser from the flutter web browser package

```dart
  makeList(){
    insights();
    blogify();
    activify();
    musicify();
    speakfy();
    theAbout();
  }
```
This is how we call all the functions in this code

```dart
  blogify() async {
    String jsonfile = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJV009/meno_mood_hack/master/netData/blog.json";
    Directory appDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    String savePath = appDirectory.path+"/blog.json";
    try {await Dio().download(jsonfile,savePath);}
    catch(e){}
    Map jsondata = json.decode(await new File(savePath).readAsString());
    jsondata.forEach((key, value) {
      blogWid.add(blogsnip(key, value));
    });
  }
```
Code to download the json file, read and add blogsnips to the app UI

```dart
  static Widget blogsnip(String desc, String url) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(3.0),
      child: SizedBox(
        width: double.infinity,
        child: FlatButton(
            color: Colors.pink.shade50,
            onPressed: () => openBrowserTab(url),
            child: Text(desc, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20.0,),),
            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
```
blogsnip - a widget for creating a clickable button with text

```dart
  barbaDataCheck() async {
    await Barbarian.init();
    try {
      water = Barbarian.read('water');
      period = Barbarian.read('period');
      sleep = Barbarian.read('sleep');
    }
    catch(e){}
    Barbarian.write('water', water);
    Barbarian.write('period', period);
    Barbarian.write('sleep', sleep);
  }
```
Using barbarian to store and retrive data from disk (water, period, sleep are dynamic list objects)

```dart
  musicify() async {
    String jsonfile = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJV009/meno_mood_hack/master/netData/music.json";
    Directory appDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    String savePath = appDirectory.path+"/music.json";
    try {await Dio().download(jsonfile,savePath);}
    catch(e){}
    Map jsondata = json.decode(await new File(savePath).readAsString());
    jsondata.forEach((key, value) {
      YoutubePlayerController controller = YoutubePlayerController(
          initialVideoId: YoutubePlayer.convertUrlToId(value),
          flags: YoutubePlayerFlags( autoPlay: false, loop: true) );
      audWid.add(YoutubePlayer( controller: controller, showVideoProgressIndicator: false, ));
    });
  }
```
The music widget which again pulls another json file, reads and creates video box.

## What I learned
- How Menopause affected women. The challenges they faced while trying to live out. There sufferings because of years long Menopause.
- Android Flutter Development

## Challenges Faced
- Memory Leak during build because of wrong dependencies.
- Being my first App I actually spend a lot of time trying to figure out various things in Flutter Development. (An experienced developer can recreate this App within 1 day.)

## TODO:
- iOS binaries (need a MacBook for iOS Development)
- Publish to Play Store and App Store
- Voice Assitant in App for touchless interface
- Smoother UI, Auto blog update, OTA update
- Replace video player with Music player which plays from YouTube and More Mozart Effect Music
- Decrease Splash Screen delays and add a image
- Replace JSON with Firebase
- Use simple on-device SVM for prediction of other symtoms and complexities. (ML)
- Forums support (discuss and share experencies)
- Voice analysis using Deep Learning (To detect emotion or feelings)

$ cd /meno_mood_hack
$ flutter clean
$ flutter run
```

### Binaries (Build using 'flutter build apk --split-per-abi')
As of now, I couldnt afford to publish in a App Store, but the binaries are available for you to download and install.
All the latest updated binaries are stored in [binaries](/binaries) folder with the architecture name as tail of the filename.

## Notes
- I learned Flutter from [Introduction to Flutter Development Using Dart course by The App Brewery created in collaboration with the Google Flutter team](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/intro-to-flutter)
- Am not any sort of advertiser of brain.fm. I have got no deal with brain.fm or any of there products. I have experienced it and has been effective throughout the project development cycle. There are more such music apps for concentration building you can try them out.
- Flowcharts were made using [Darw.io](https://www.draw.io/), a desktop version is available too.
- This project will remain Open Source forever! **(I LOVE OS)**
- **Being my first Flutter project I'll keep on completing the TODO list as they are easy just bit of time consuming because am fairly new to mobile develoment. So watch and star this repository for updates. Also this project will be a nice addition to my resume.**
